Welcome to the **NeoChemSynthWave: Data** project !!!

Over the past decade, computer-assisted chemical synthesis has re-emerged as a prominent research subject.
Even though the idea of utilizing computers to assist chemical synthesis has existed for nearly as long as computers themselves, the inherent complexity repeatedly exceeded the available resources.
However, recent machine learning approaches have exhibited the potential to break this tendency.
The performance of such approaches is dependent on data that frequently suffer from limited quantity, quality, visibility, and accessibility, posing significant challenges to potential scientific breakthroughs.
Consequently, the primary objective of the **NeoChemSynthWave: Data** project is to provide access to essential open computer-assisted chemical synthesis data.
