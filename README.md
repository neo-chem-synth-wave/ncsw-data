Welcome to the **NeoChemSynthWave: Data** project !!!

Over the past decade, computer-assisted chemical synthesis has re-emerged as a prominent research subject. Even though
the idea of utilizing computers to assist chemical synthesis has existed for nearly as long as computers themselves, the
inherent complexity repeatedly exceeded the available resources. However, recent machine learning approaches have
exhibited the potential to break this tendency. The performance of such approaches is dependent on data that frequently
suffer from limited quantity, quality, visibility, and accessibility, posing significant challenges to potential
scientific breakthroughs. Consequently, the primary objective of the **NeoChemSynthWave: Data** project is to provide
access to essential open computer-assisted chemical synthesis data.


## Installation
An environment can be created using the [git](https://git-scm.com) and [conda](https://conda.io) commands as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/neo-chem-synth-wave/ncsw-data.git

cd ncsw-data

conda env create -f environment.yaml

conda activate ncsw-data-env
```

The [ncsw_data](/ncsw_data) package can be installed using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) command as follows:

```shell
pip install .
```
